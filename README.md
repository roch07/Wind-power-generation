# ⚡ Wind Power Generation Forecasting using Deep Learning

This project is a full pipeline for predicting **wind power generation** based on meteorological weather data using a **deep learning model** in Python.

---

## 📈 Project Summary

The goal of this project was to build a model that accurately forecasts wind power generation given weather conditions like wind speed, humidity, temperature, and more. This kind of prediction can help with:

- **Optimizing renewable energy usage**
- **Balancing power grids**
- **Forecasting for energy trading markets**

---

## 🧠 What I Did

### ✅ Data Processing
- Loaded a large dataset (43k+ hourly entries)
- Parsed and indexed by timestamp
- Engineered time-based features: `hour`, `dayofweek`, and `month`
- Scaled features using `StandardScaler`

### ✅ Modeling
- Trained a **feedforward deep neural network** with TensorFlow/Keras
- Input: Weather conditions (`windspeed`, `humidity`, `temperature`, etc.)
- Output: Predicted wind **Power** for each hour
- Train/test split with validation

### ✅ Evaluation
- **MAE**: ~0.12
- **RMSE**: ~0.15
- **R² Score**: ~0.69  
(≈ 69% of variance in power output explained by the model)

### ✅ Visualizations
- Line plots: Actual vs. Predicted Power
- Scatter plots: Prediction accuracy
- Error plot: Where the model performs best/worst
- Heatmap: Feature correlations

### ✅ Prediction Function
- Accepts any weather input as a dictionary
- Outputs predicted wind power in real time

## 🧪 Example Prediction

```python
input_weather = {
    'temperature_2m': 30.2,
    'relativehumidity_2m': 88,
    'dewpoint_2m': 27,
    'windspeed_10m': 3.54,
    'windspeed_100m': 6.89,
    'winddirection_10m': 74,
    'winddirection_100m': 81,
    'windgusts_10m': 5.8,
    'hour': 8,
    'dayofweek': 0,
    'month': 1
}

# Output: 🔋 Predicted Power Output: 0.1452
```
